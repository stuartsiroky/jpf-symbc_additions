This set of files/packages needs to be copied over into a jpf-symb project. 

under src_examples copied to src/examples in jpf-symbc
	this folder contains the case study code of the calc MVC with some minor 
	modification to allow jpf to run on it. the packages are all prefixed with calc.*
	
	There is a testCase package that has some other code that could be run but is 
	not necessary.
	
	the .jpf files are the ones that are used to run JPF the most important one is
	CalcPathTest.jpf it runs the case study and can be run from the top of the MVC
	or from the equals method uncomment the right line. 
	
The src_main needs to be copied to the src/main of the jpf-symbc
	the packages bfsNode, codeExample, data_obj, graph, and jimpleParser are all from 
	the BFS_thesis_alg project but it did not like being include externally. you will 
	also need the bcel.jar.
	
	the gov.nasa.jpf.symbc contains the listener code. 
	BFSSymbolicListener.java is a modified version of the SymbolicListener provide by
	jpf. It does the bulk of the calculation and work with the call graph. 
	The other two listeners inherit from this one and change some parameter 
	like the starting and ending method. there is probably a better way to do this but
	I haven't figured it out.
